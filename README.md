<h1>Machine Learning for Early Brain Stroke Detection</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on the early detection of brain stroke using Machine Learning techniques.
A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, leading to brain cell damage or death.
Early detection is critical to reduce mortality and long-term disability.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide. Several risk factors such as age, blood pressure,
heart disease, diabetes, and lifestyle habits contribute to stroke occurrence.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient medical data and predict
the possibility and type of stroke. Four machine learning models are implemented and evaluated.
The results show satisfactory accuracy, proving that machine learning can support real-time
medical diagnosis and decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Stroke occurs due to poor blood supply to the brain. The major types of stroke are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ischemic Stroke:</strong> Caused by blockage of blood vessels.</li>
  <li><strong>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</strong> Caused by bleeding in the brain.</li>
  <li><strong>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):</strong> A temporary stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ischemic stroke can be further classified into embolic and thrombotic strokes.
This project aims to detect stroke early using machine learning by analyzing patient health data.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To develop an accurate method for stroke detection</li>
  <li>To enable early diagnosis for timely medical intervention</li>
  <li>To improve prediction accuracy using machine learning models</li>
  <li>To provide a cost-effective and efficient solution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<p>
Previous research shows that machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees and Support
Vector Machines are effective in predicting stroke risk. These models analyze patient data
including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors.
Although promising, challenges include dataset quality, feature selection,
and model interpretability.
